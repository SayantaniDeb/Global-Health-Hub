## What it does

Global Health Hub is a telemedicine app that unites and supports cultural diversity by providing patients with access to healthcare providers who are trained in cultural competency. The app allows patients to easily connect with providers, schedule appointments, and receive virtual medical care from the comfort of their
 own homes.

## How we built it

We built Global Health Hub using React JS for the frontend and Tailwind CSS for styling. React JS allowed us to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces quickly and efficiently, while Tailwind CSS provided a simple and intuitive way to style our components. By combining these two technologies, we were able to create a sleek and modern app that delivers a great user experience.

Throughout the development process, we used modern software engineering practices such as component-based architecture, modular code design, and version control to ensure that our code was organized, maintainable, and scalable. We also made use of various libraries and tools such as React Router and React-lottie to have desired UI.
Overall, our use of React JS and Tailwind CSS enabled us to build a high-quality app with a modern look and feel.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was creating a user-friendly interface that would accommodate the needs of patients from different cultures. We also had to ensure that the app complied with healthcare regulations and was secure enough to protect patient information.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of creating an app that addresses the need for culturally-sensitive healthcare services. We were able to build a platform that connects patients with healthcare providers who are trained to provide quality care while respecting cultural differences.

## What we learned

 Throughout the development process, we learned a lot about the importance of cultural competency in healthcare and the challenges of designing an app that accommodates patients from different cultures. We also gained valuable experience in integrating third-party APIs and complying with healthcare regulations.

## What's next for Global Health Hub

Our next steps for Global Health Hub include expanding the platform to include additional healthcare services and reaching more patients and healthcare providers globally. We also plan to conduct user testing and gather feedback to continually improve the app's functionality and user experience.
